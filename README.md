## 🗂 Organizational Structure

This project is organized across three main tools:

### 📦 GitHub Repository
Source code, scripts, documentation, and issue tracking are maintained here.  
We use branches, pull requests, and GitHub Projects to organize tasks.

### 📄 Google Docs  
[Shared document for writing research notes, planning, meeting summaries, and discussion of ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1kVfFjQbXq8OdFGCSOu9GP_EXO3aulRecfcXGN_ks/edit?usp=sharing)

---

### 💬 Discord Server  
[Main channel for team communication, quick updates, screen sharing, and daily coordination](https://discord.gg/p9fqusES)

Each team member uses their preferred IDE (e.g., **PyCharm** or **VS Code**).  
Tasks are created and assigned via GitHub Issues, with status updates managed through the GitHub Project Board.
