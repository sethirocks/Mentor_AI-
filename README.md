📁 Organizational Structure

This project is organized across three main tools:
	•	📦 GitHub Repository
Source code, scripts, documentation, and issue tracking are maintained here. We use branches, pull requests, and GitHub Projects to organize tasks.
	•	📄 Google Docs 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ylXkVfFjQbXq8OdFGCSOu9GP_EXO3auIRecfcXGN_ks/edit?usp=sharing
Shared document for writing research notes, planning, meeting summaries, and discussion of ideas.
	•	💬 Discord Server
  https://discord.gg/p9fqusES
Main channel for team communication, quick updates, screen sharing, and daily coordination.

Each team member uses their preferred IDE (e.g. PyCharm or VS Code). 

Tasks are created and assigned via GitHub Issues, with status updates managed through the GitHub Project Board.
